  <ul>
    <li>A security flaw is detected in the 1.7.x branch of the framework</li>
    <li>
      One of the major browsers releases a version that will cause current production applications
      using AngularJS 1.7.x to stop working
    </li>
    <li>
      The jQuery library releases a version that will cause current production applications using
